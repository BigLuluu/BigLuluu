- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigLuluu, or also go by Christina (Lu) Jin, interested in Data Mining, ML, AI and software developing. 
- 👀 I’ve recently earned my Data Analytics Master's Degree with a concentration in Applied Machine Intelligence and Statistical Modeling.
- 👀 And currently taking algorithm and OOD courses in Java and ~ also getting trained to achieve my advanced scuba diving certificate :).
- 👀 I'm curious about how data interact with human and human behaviors, and how algorithm can improve our living.
- 🌱 I’m also interested in human-centered design, both spatial (architecture/interior) and experiential (product and UI/UX).
- 🌱 I'm very outdoorsy, in my spare time you can find me snowboarding, wakeboarding, riding horses, dancing, , cooking and traveling.
- 💞️ Looking forward to collaborate on data-driven projects or Object Oriented Design & System Design projects.
- 📫 Reach me at callmesherlock.cj@gmail.com
